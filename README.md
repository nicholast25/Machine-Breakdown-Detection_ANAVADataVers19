# Machine Breakdown Detection - Data Science Competition ANAVA DataVers UGM (Universitas Gadjah Mada)

## Overview
This project presents our solution for a data science competition on machine breakdown detection, in which our team achieved a **Top 9 (waiting list) finish**. The objective was to **predict machine failures** using **statistical analysis, feature selection, and machine learning models**. Our approach addressed **class imbalance** by splitting the dataset into **majority and minority cases** while ensuring **robust** evaluation and **feature engineering**.

## Key Features
1. Non-Parametric Statistical Testing: Applied Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-Square tests to analyze feature significance.
2. Multicollinearity Analysis: Used Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect and remove redundant numerical features.
3. Dimensionality Reduction: Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that represents at least 80% of data variance to enhance model efficiency.
4. Machine Learning Models: Developed a Random Forest Classifier for robust prediction.
5. Imbalanced Data Handling: Split data into majority and minority classes to improve model learning.
